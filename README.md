## Introduction
Over the years front end development has evolved to do things that the browser was never designed to do. The internet was originally designed to serve static text files, but now hosts a wealt of flashy grapics and dynamically updating content that interacts with user input. JavaScript was never designed to do this. This is the problem that the majority of front end frame works are trying to solve. In this morning challenge you will try to dynamically update the DOM as state changes.
